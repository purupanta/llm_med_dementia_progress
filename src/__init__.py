Version:
    1.0

Purpose:
    Supports the dementia_progression pipeline for medication-state-aware and LLM-
    enhanced machine learning prediction of next-visit dementia progression among mild
    cognitive impairment visits.

Notes:
    This project uses participant-level train-validation-test splitting to prevent
    participant-level leakage. Neuropathology variables are excluded from model training
    and used only for secondary biological plausibility anchoring. Medication-state and
    LLM-derived features are interpreted as predictive patient-state representations,
    not as causal medication effects.
